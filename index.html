        <p><strong>At $33k, this NFT sneaker is super good value!</strong></p>
        <p>If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a
          great way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic
          value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT
          bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images.
          Our advice: spend the weekend <a href="">crafting an NFT</a> and by
          this time next week, you'll be a millionaire.</p>

        <p>Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk
          (left) is a steal at $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 (right) a
          total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the way, that's not a VS
          Code screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white text
          on a black background is the actual NFT we're selling.</p>

        <p>Still not convinced? To be honest, nor are we. That's why we're selling
          them, not buying them.</p>
